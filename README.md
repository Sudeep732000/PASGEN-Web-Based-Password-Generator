# PASGEN-Web-Based-Password-Generator
  This project solves the security concern of weak passwords. Given that a user needs a new, secured password, they will be promted to determine certain character types required for the password and then a new random password will be generated.The new password implements greater security to sensitive data and saves time for users.I have implemented using javascript for the logic and html and css for the web structure.

Those who need to see the copied password in clipboard PRESS { WindowKey + V }.....
